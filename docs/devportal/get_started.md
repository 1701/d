    A strong password does not need to be changed regularly. However, it should consist of at least 8 characters, better 12 or more. The longer your password, the harder it is to crack. Also mix letters, numbers and special characters and switch between upper and lower case.

### Company Details

Creating a new account also requires you to create an associate company profile, which is the legal entity that operates the services that you are integrating the Single Sign-on into. Fill out the necessary details, read the terms of use and accept the user contract.

To complete the registration, click on **Complete registration**.

    Accepting the user contract requires you to be eligible to act on behalf of your company (as registered in this step). The developer portal supports different roles to address that, namely **Developer** and **Representative**. After finishing the signup process the registered user has the role **Representative**
