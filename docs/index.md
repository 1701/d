# About netID

## European netID Foundation (EnID)

The European netID Foundation was founded in March 2018 by Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, ProSiebenSat.1 and United Internet. Its aim is to establish the netID single sign-on as a European alternative to US providers. With netID, users can organize their consent to the use of internet services (opt-ins) transparently and in compliance with data protection regulations. To this end, the foundation has developed an open standard that enables users from all sectors to access all internet services of partners of the European netID Foundation with the same log-in. Right from the start which focuses the initial core market Germany, 38 million accounts covering roughly about 60% of the Germany online population are ready to be used.

## Developer Portal

The netID Developer Portal is the main contact point for developers who want to connect their online services as netID Partner to the Single Sign on service netID.

The Developer Portal provides developers with information for a smooth integration.

In the future, individual reports, information about planned further developments of the netID login standard and much more will be available in the Developer Portal.

## netID Login Standard

netID is the new, european login standard of the European netID Foundation.

The European netID Foundation offers the federal single sign-on "netID", which allows a large number of relying parties (so-called netID partners) to access many netID account providers.

The relying parties request the authorized transfer of user data from a central netID broker (using the common technology standard OpenID Connect.

The data transmission and authentication of the end user is done by the corresponding netID account provider. The results are passed back from the broker to the requesting client.

The data required for registration and use of your services are transmitted free of charge and securely by the described netID system.
