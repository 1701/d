## Read APIs

### User identifier

If the ORIGIN is eligible, a publisher (TAPP) can retrieve the userâ€™s identifier (TPID) via the following interface:

``` shell
GET https://READSERVICE.netid.de/identification/tpid?tapp_id=<TAPP_ID>
Accept: application/vnd.netid.identification.tpid-read-v1+json
Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
Origin: <ORIGIN>
```

``` shell
200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.identification.tpid-read-v1+json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

{
  "tpid": "<TPID>|null"
  "status": "OK|NO_TPID|TOKEN_ERROR|CONSENT_REQUIRED"
}
```

**JSON Properties**

| |Description|
|---|---|
| tpid | Users identifier (`tpid`). Only present if consent "Identification" is given, the `tpid` is present and status "OK". Otherwise null. |

| status | meaning | tpid |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | Call successful | x |
| NO_TPID | There was no tpid_sec cookie available. | - |
| TOKEN_ERROR | Token (JWT) in the cookie has expired or is invalid. | - |
| CONSENT_REQUIRED | Consent for passing on the TPID missing ("Identification"). | - |

### Privacy status

``` shell
GET https://READSERVICE.netid.de/permissions/iab-permissions?
    tapp_id=<TAPP_ID>
    Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
    Origin: <ORIGIN>
```

``` shell
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

{
  "tpid": "<TPID>|null",
  "tc": "<TC string>|null",
  "status": "OK|NO_TPID|TOKEN_ERROR|CONSENT_REQUIRED"
}
```

**JSON Properties**

| |Description|
|---|---|
| tpid | Users identifier (`tpid`). Only present if consent "Identification" is given, the `tpid` is present and status "OK". Otherwise null. |
| tc | The TC string stored for this `tpid` for this publisher (TCF 2.0). Only with status "OK". Otherwise null. |

| status | meaning | tc | pid |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | Status successfully retrieved | x | x |
| NO_TPID | There was no tpid_sec cookie available. | - | - |
| TOKEN_ERROR | Token (JWT) in the cookie has expired or is invalid. | - | - |
| CONSENT_REQUIRED | Consent for passing on the TPID missing ("Identification"). | x | - |

## Write API

### Privacy status

``` shell
POST https://WRITESERVICE.netid.de/permissions/iab-permissions?
      tapp_id=<TAPP_ID>
      Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
      Origin: <ORIGIN>

{
  "identification": "true|false",
  "tc": "<TC string>"
}
```

``` shell
201 CREATED
Location: https://READSERVICE.netid.de/permissions/iab-permissions?
      tapp_id=<TAPP_ID>
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

{
  "tpid": "<TPID>|null",
  "status": "OK|NO_TPID|TOKEN_ERROR"
}
```

Remarks:

- If permission "identification" has been given by the user, this must be signaled by passing "identification: true". For the avoidance of doubt, this of course requires the prior collection of this consent by the CMP.
- If only the TC string is to be updated and the permission "Identification" already exists, only the "tc" attribute can be passed. Both can also be written at the same time.
- In case of revocation of permission "Identification", would pass only "identification: false".

**JSON Properties**

**request**

| |Description|
|---|---|
| identification | Boolean flag, indicating the status of the permission "Identification". <br>*Yes* = Consent given <br> *No* = consent not given / revoked |
| tc | The TC String which should be stored for this this user in relation to the netID Partner (TCF 2.0) |

**response**

| |Description|
|---|---|
| tpid | Users identifier (`tpid`). Only present if consent "Identification" is given, the `tpid` is present and status "OK". Otherwise null.|

| status | meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | TC String / ID CONSENT was saved. |
| NO_TPID | There was no `tpid_sec` cookie available. |
