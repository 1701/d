Its aim is to establish the netID single sign-on as a European alternative to US providers. With netID, users can organize their consent to the use of internet services (opt-ins) transparently and in compliance with data protection regulations. To this end, the foundation has developed an open standard that enables users from all sectors to access all internet services of partners of the European netID Foundation with the same log-in. Right from the start which focuses the initial core market Germany, 38 million accounts covering roughly about 60% of the Germany online population are ready to be used. Developer Portal \u00b6 The netID Developer Portal is the main contact point for developers who want to connect their online services as netID Partner to the Single Sign on service netID. The Developer Portal provides developers with information for a smooth integration. In the future, individual reports, information about planned further developments of the netID login standard and much more will be available in the Developer Portal. netID Login Standard \u00b6 netID is the new, european login standard of the European netID Foundation. The European netID Foundation offers the federal single sign-on \"netID\", which allows a large number of relying parties (so-called netID partners) to access many netID account providers. The relying parties request the authorized transfer of user data from a central netID broker (using the common technology standard OpenID Connect. The data transmission and authentication of the end user is done by the corresponding netID account provider. The results are passed back from the broker to the requesting client. Thus, visitors and customers can discover and use your online offers and websites via netID in a particularly secure, simple and convenient way. The data required for registration and use of your services are transmitted free of charge and securely by the described netID system. User reach and advantages \u00b6 netID can be used with any e-mail address. Over 35 million users can already use netID without further registration. This includes all e-mail users of the brands WEB.DE and GMX. And users who do not yet have a netID can create a free netID account with one of the netID account providers with just a few clicks. Optimized & convenient : Fewer interruptions in the purchasing process, less \"password recovery\" effort. Significantly better conversion rates in the registration process for new customers. Free & Federal : Easy registration and free administration of your netID Developer Account with as many netID integrations as you wish. Secure & independent : Decentralized Data Storage. Of course, your customers and data remain. GDPR compliant and only with approved netID participants. Reach & familiar : Reach already more than 35 million users with the integration of the netID Login. These users do not need any additional registration.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#about-netid","text":"","title":"About netID"},{"location":"#european-netid-foundation-enid","text":"The European netID Foundation was founded in March 2018 by Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, ProSiebenSat.1 and United Internet.

Data export (exporting the netID permissions / TC String of the partner) The distinction browser vs. server-based refers mainly to how active users are identified / from where the APIs are being called.

This ID token is not accessible for partners / the CMP. The Login token can be retrieved by a publisher during the SSO process (OpenID Connect) in the form of a claim. This enables read/write access independently of the SSO session (limited in time). If, depending on the context, the token or the tpid_sec does not exist, has expired or is invalid, a publisher cannot read/write the TC String and of course cannot access the TPID.","title":"General information"},{"location":"cmp/cmp_1/#general-information","text":"This White Paper was prepared by the European netID Foundation (\"EnID\") and by 1&1 Mail & Media GmbH (\"1&1\") - as a recognized technical service provider of \"EnID\" - to the best of their knowledge, with due diligence and taking into account the current state of knowledge and development. \"EnID\" and \"1&1\" and their legal representatives and/or vicarious agents do not guarantee that the contents of this white paper are secure, completely usable for certain purposes or otherwise free of errors.

In order to aquire the necessary credentials to leverage this service please refer to the Developer Portal Documentation Integration Guide \u00b6 General Overview \u00b6 The protocol standard applied is OpenID Connect as per the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification using the Authorization Code Flow. Partners manage their data and clients in the netID Developer Portal. There, partners are able to manage their services, which may constitute groups of clients. These services receive the rights granted to partners by end users, which all clients in the group then have access to. All the clients' communication takes place via EnID's central SSO broker. The SSO broker distributes requests among the participating account providers, end users always authenticate to the account provider responsible for them, which is also where they authorize the release of their data for partners' services. Where necessary, clients request that data be released netID users; if the user agrees, the client receives an id_token and a userinfo object as a JSON structure. What the id_token and userinfo objects contain in particular is the end user's subject identifier (sub), which constitutes an ID for both the end user with regard to the service he or she is using as well as the actual client's redirect URI (redirect_uri). This sub value allows the end user to be recognized on the client. Claims und Scopes \u00b6 Every time netID is used to initiate an SSO process, details regarding which information is expected from the end user in the context of the request have to be provided. For that purpose, the OpenID Connect/OAuth2 scope and claim mechanisms serve as definitions. Every OpenID Connect request must always request the openid scope. Moreover, the master data required are to be expressed as essential claims. Once released by the end user, master data need not be provided again unless revoked by the user. The user's approval is saved. The following claims are supported by netID: gender - the end user's gender given_name - the end user's first name (or names) family_name - the end user's last name birthdate - the end user's date of birth email - the end user's email address email_verified - the verification status of the end user's email address address - physical mailing address, containing informations on postal code (ZIP), city or town, steet address and country where the end user's address is located The availability of these claims may, however, vary depending on the end user's account provider; in such cases where not all requested claims are provided, the client must find a way around this. Claims and scopes that are not requested as essential are ignored. Examples \u00b6 authorize \u00b6 authorize requests initiate SSO processes, the clients identify themselves with their client_id and redirect_uri and specify which claims and scopes are to be requested. Some optional parameters are also supported. Here, the endpoint https://broker.netid.de/authorize is used with the SSO broker. Examples, given both easy readable as well as in valid URL encoding. The encoding needs to be used for the redirect_uri as well: Minimum Query - SSO without requesting any additional data https://broker.netid.de/authorize? response_type = code & client_id =[ clientID ] & redirect_uri =[ redirect_uri ] & scope = openid Query for \u201cprofile\u201d scope as essential claim https://broker.netid.de/authorize? response_type = code & client_id =[ clientID ] & redirect_uri =[ redirect_uri ] & scope = openid & claims ={ \"userinfo\" : { \"birthdate\" : { \"essential\" :true } , \"gender\" : { \"essential\" :true } , \"given_name\" : { \"essential\" :true } , \"family_name\" : { \"essential\" :true } } } Query for claims that correspond to the \u201cprofile\u201d scope and \u201caddress\u201d as essential https://broker.netid.de/authorize? response_type = code & client_id =[ clientID ] & redirect_uri =[ redirect_uri ] & scope = openid & claims ={ \"userinfo\" : { \"birthdate\" : { \"essential\" :true } , \"address\" : { \"essential\" :true } , \"gender\" : { \"essential\" :true } , \"given_name\" : { \"essential\" :true } , \"family_name\" : { \"essential\" :true } } } token \u00b6 Token requests are carried out after the callback to the client in order to exchange the code provided for an access token. It is absolutely necessary that the code used remains unmodified. Here, the endpoint https://broker.netid.de/token is used with the SSO broker. Client Credentials are required for basic authentication. Example request per curl: curl -v -u [user:pass] -X POST https://broker.netid.de/token -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' -d 'code=[code]&redirect_uri=[redirect_uri]&grant_type=authorization_code' userinfo \u00b6 The access token is used to retrieve userinfo and id_token. Here, the endpoint https://broker.netid.de/userinfo is used with the SSO broker. Timing and Error Messages \u00b6 If the authorize request fails, the redirect_uri in the callback is given the reason why this occurred. With token requests, it's particularly important to ensure that the code provided is identical bit-by-bit to the one received in the callback to the redirect_uri, and to be able to assume that basic authentication is being used properly here. Each code is only valid for 30 seconds! Access tokens for the userinfo request are valid for 15 minutes and may also be used multiple times within this timeframe. Implementation Details \u00b6 The following request parameters are supported for initiating the SSO process: prompt login for requiring reauthentication with the account provider consent for requiring consent to be given again max_age in cases where time of authentication may not be too far in the past login_hint to provide and email address in order to prevent the broker's user interface from being visible to the user and thus directly redirect to the relevant account provider state The value of this parameter is passed through the entire flow transparently and included when calling back to the redirect_uri. It may be used to recognize how authorize request and asynchronous response are associated in the client. The sequence of the calls is summarized as follows: Detailed description of diagram: The end user initiates a process on the client's site that involves the use of netID. At this point, the client generates a netID button for an authorize request and redirects the end user to the SSO broker. The SSO broker validates the client's authorize request. The SSO broker generates a new authorize request and redirects the user to the OpenID provider. For their part, the broker appears to the OpenID provider as a relying party client. The OpenID provider validates the SSO broker's authorize request and displays the login screen to the end user; the user logs in with the account provider. The OpenID provider shows an approval page to the end user on which all the data he or she is asked to allow transfer of is displayed. The end user agrees to provide the requested data. The OpenID provider generates an AuthN Response and redirects to the SSO broker. The SSO broker receives the AuthN Response from the OpenID provider. The SSO broker generates a new AuthN Response and redirects to the client's redirect_uri. The client receives the SSO broker's AuthN Response. The actual data query is initiated. The client requests the access token with the SSO broker using the Auth Code (from the AuthN Response) and the Client Credentials. The SSO broker requests the access token from the OP using the Auth Code (from the AuthN Response) and the Client Credentials taken from the client. The OpenID provider issues an access token, giving it to the SSO broker. The SSO broker uses the access token to generate a new access token, giving this one to the client. The client uses the access token with the SSO broker to request the userinfo object. The SSO broker uses the access token to request the userinfo object from the OpenID provider. The OpenID provider grants the userinfo object to the SSO broker. The SSO broker grants the userinfo object to the client. The client has now received the userinfo object. Styling \u00b6 The depiction of the netID button is explained in the brand book. Best Practices \u00b6 It is largely up to the relying parties to decide where netID is to be incorporated in clients. Typical cases involve the use of netID as a login or data enrichment mechanism. As a login mechanism, for example, netID may be used like other SSO mechanisms (as well as alongside them) as an authentication alternative, or even used as the sole login method. Whether or not a local account is to be held in addition to the netID account is entirely up to the relying party. netID does not provide a classic session, but the SSO process is available via the authorize process at all times. An email address provided to the broker via a browser will be stored as a 1 st -party cookie; the end user may decide whether to remain logged in with the account provider. The end user's approval for the transfer of master data will be sought only upon the first request for such data, unless the user revokes his or her approval; ideally, this allows SSO flows to be able to run even with interaction from the user. If a relying party would like to also be able to handle authentication of end users independently of netID, it is advisable to ensure that mechanisms for merging or separating accounts are provided for. If local account representations with local credentials exist alongside netID, there should also be support processes for handling them; netID support processes only come into effect in connection with netID accounts themselves. In terms of data enrichment, examples may include using netID during registration processes to make it easier for users to enter information, or as a source for addresses when customers are checking out with their shopping carts online. Whether the data provided is to be used only temporarily or whether it should persist is again left up to the relying parties to freely decide. Each time netID is triggered, the data obtained is up to date in relation to the information currently available to the account provider. With regard to local copies, it may be reasonable to repeatedly request updates and synchronize them. The relying party is to take the principles of data protection into account as they pertain to local data retention. Ideally, data enrichment processes should be initiated in those places where the data is actually needed. This helps to optimize conversion rates while achieving a high degree of data minimization. One thing to be aware of is the verification status of email addresses: if an email address has already been verified with netID, a new request from the relying party to verify the email address is, generally speaking, unnecessary and may cause confusion on the part of the end user. Those netID accounts associated with account providers that are, for their part, email providers, are verified from the outset. If such an email account is deleted, not only does the end user lose the ability to use netID, but all support processes based on that email address will come to nothing. Security Information \u00b6 All communication with netID must be secured by TLS. This also applies to all URLs entered in the developer portal. netID exclusively supports the Authorization Code Flow, so that id_token is only transferred in TLS-secured back-end to back-end communication. Currently, the only token signature supported is none. Use of SDKs \u00b6 There are a large number of OpenID Connect client libraries available in many different language environments. Below, several examples will be given, along with tips for using them. Many client libraries are listed at https://openid.net/developers/libraries/ , and others are easy to find. General \u00b6 Regardless of the choice of environment, it's possible to do the following preliminary experiments: In the developer portal for the partner, create a service, request approval for it, and then create a client for it When choosing which URLs to use, it's possible to generate locally applicable test environments by making an entry in the hosts file of a developer workstation at the endpoints given for service and client and creating and using self-signed certificates. Example \"Entry in hosts\" 127.0.0.1 www.democlient.de Example \"Creating a self-signed certificate\" openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem Here, for the Common Name give the host name of the environment you want; so, in this case: www.democlient.de . Using the Client Credentials from the developer portal, the local host entry, and the certificate with the key, it's possible to run through the netID requests. When testing with browsers, it's a good idea to use private windows; otherwise cookies left behind from previous run-throughs may cause confusion. to top Examples \u00b6 PHP In PHP it's possible to use the package https://github.com/jumbojett/OpenID-Connect-PHP.However , some adjustments are necessary, since netID always uses none for the token signature algorithm in the Authorization Code Flow. Installation according to instructions is no problem. The package derives the redirect_uri from its own URL; here, the position of the script in the path of the web server can either be used as redirect_uri when creating the client or configured accordingly in the web server using rewrite rules.
